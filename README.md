###The number of public API's is estimated to be at over 10,000

We live in a world where data is created in real time.

From Weather Data To Twitter Geo Location,
The web is filled with API's that can be connected into new types of applications.

By using Guzzle we can develop rapid prototypes connecting APIs into applications.

> ### Have a working knowledge of how to implement a new API
--

#### The goal of this training material is to rapidly prototype and implement API's with Guzzle.

#### We will focus on applying a software engineering methodology that lets you focus on quickly developing working code.

##At the end of this guide you will be able to do the following:
> ### Share data with an API
> --
> ### Connect two API's together
> --
> ### Apply creative usages with the vast amount of APIs
--

##Pre-requisites
##For our agenda in this topic:

    Utilize CRUD statements in SQL - Create, read, update and delete records in a database.
    Simple authentication and security - Logging in and out, handling unauthorized users and restricting access.
    Simple time and date manipulation - Displaying time and date postings and monitoring your posts.
    Displaying public and private data - Simply display information for logged-in users only and for the public
    De-briefing and Summary - Final output and some notes. FAQ's are also place here.
