	To apply CRUD Methodology with Guzzle

Goal is to share a software engineering methodology that 
lets you focus on quickly developing working code.

Rapidly prototype a wokring CRUD example with Guzzle.

We will keep the scope and requirements clean.
As well as testing the code for errors and handling them gracefully.

At the end of this guide you will be able to do the following:

- Share data with an API
- Connect two API's togehter
- Apply creative usages with the wide word of APIs
