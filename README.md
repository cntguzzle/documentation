##Introduction:

###What Is An API?
> 
### API (*Application Programming Interface*)
####A way for applications to connect and share data programmatically.

###**What Is CRUD?**
> ### CRUD (*Create,Read,Update,Delete*)
> ####A methodology for organizing an application.

###**What Is Guzzle?**
> ####*A FrameWork For Working With API's And HTTP Client Requests*

###The number of public API's is estimated to be at over 10,000

We live in a world where data is created in real time.

The web is filled with API's that can be connected into new types of applications.

By using Guzzle we can develop rapid prototypes connecting APIs into applications.


##A few facts about the Instagram API 
* On an average day there are...
	* 40 million Photos Uploaded Per Day
	* 8,500 Likes Created Per Second
	* 1,000 Comments Per Second
</br>

*  How would you interact with that data?
* What types of applications could you build leveraging the data?

###*The future of the web is about connecting and sharing data.*

##Course Overview And Expectations
> ###To apply CRUD Methodology with Guzzle To GitHub
 


####The goal of this training material is to rapidly prototype and implement API's with Guzzle.

We will focus on applying a software engineering methodology that lets
you focus on quickly developing working code.


##What Will We Cover?

###At the end of this guide you will be able to do the following:

- Share data with an API
- Connect two API's together
- Apply creative usages with the vast amount of APIs

##Pre-requisites
##For our agenda in this topic:

    Utilize CRUD statements in SQL - Create, read, update and delete records in a database.
    Simple authentication and security - Logging in and out, handling unauthorized users and restricting access.
    Simple time and date manipulation - Displaying time and date postings and monitoring your posts.
    Displaying public and private data - Simply display information for logged-in users only and for the public
    De-briefing and Summary - Final output and some notes. FAQ's are also place here.
